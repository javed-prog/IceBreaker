1. One night, I was walking on the Hauptstrasse.
2. After listening to some musik I realized something important - I did not have much time left!
3. My brot of bread at home was going to be stale tonight...
4. I rushed off to the market to get some fresh bread and bratwurst.
5. I would have also got beer but I already went to the biergarten.
6. The cashier in the store who was wearing Lederhose, was listening to the musik.
7. It turns out he was only wearing Lederhose, becuase the Klimaanlage stopped working.
8. I also bought some Senf because I was not gonna make two trips all the way to Munich.
9. I asked the cashier what he was listening to, and he said Rammstein.
