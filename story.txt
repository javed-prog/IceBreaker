1. One night, I was walking on the Hauptstrasse.
2. After listening to some musik I realized something important - I did not have much time left!
3. My brot of bread at home was going to be stale tonight...
4. I rushed off to the market to get some fresh bread and bratwurst.
5. I would have also got beer but I already went to the biergarten.
6. The cashier in the store who was wearing Lederhose, was listening to the musik.
7. I asked the cashier what he was listening to, and he said Rammstein.
